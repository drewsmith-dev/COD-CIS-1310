            <p>The first national park, Yellowstone, was designated in 1987 by President Ulysses S. Grant. Since then, many more spaces have been congressionally designated as national parks, with the United States having a total of 63 national parks today. These parks are kept as protected areas to preserve their natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and recreational opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>The National Park Service</strong>, an agency of the Department of the Interior, oversees and operates the national parks. The agency was created in 1916 when President Woodrow Wilson signed the <em>Organic Act</em> into law.</p>
